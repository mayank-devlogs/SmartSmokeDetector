The Smart Smoke Detector System is a Java-based simulation project designed to demonstrate the working concept of a smoke detection and alert system using virtual sensors.

The system continuously monitors smoke or gas concentration levels and triggers alerts when the readings cross a predefined safety threshold. It can be extended for IoT or embedded implementations using real sensors such as MQ-2 or MQ-135
